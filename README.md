# LeetCodeNotes in Obsidian

As I work on Leetcode problems I am storing their solutions in Obsidian - a notetaking app that creates a network between your individual notes. I believe that building a repository of connected notes will allow me and others to identify patterns in these problems. This will allow for an understanding on a **deeper** level.
