# Linked List 
Data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

## Time Complexity 
- Access: O(n)
	- Accessing an element in the linked list requires traversal of each element one by one.
- Search: O(n)
	- Searching an element in the linked list requires traversal of each element one by one.
- Insert/Delete: O(1)
	- Inserting or deleting an element at the start of the linked list will be O(1). However if you add or delete from the end of the list, you will have to traverse the entire list so it would be O(n)

## Common operations

### Reverse List
